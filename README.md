# Persistent Weather

Keep the weather cycle going - even after sleeping in a bed!

Uses the same timers for rain and thunderstorms as the vanilla game:

- Rain starts every 12000-180000 ticks (0.5-7.5 Minecraft days)
- Rain lasts for 12000-24000 ticks (0.5-1 Minecraft days)
- Thunderstorms start every 12000-180000 ticks (0.5-7.5 Minecraft days), however note that like the vanilla game a thunderstorm will only start if it is already raining
- Thunderstorms last for 3600-15600 ticks (0.15-0.65 Minecraft days)

This data pack currently requires the [PseudoRNG datapack](https://github.com/Goodlookinguy/PseudoRNG) to generate the countdown timers.
